I understand. In TypeScript, you need to define the props for the ProtectedRoute component to include the children property. Here's an updated version of the ProtectedRoute component that should work with TypeScript:

```
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { Navigate, Outlet, PropsWithChildren } from 'react-router-dom';

interface ProtectedRouteProps {
  roles: string[];
}

const ProtectedRoute: React.FC<PropsWithChildren<ProtectedRouteProps>> = ({ roles, children }) => {
  const userRole = useSelector((state) => state.user.role);

  if (roles.includes(userRole)) {
    return <Outlet />;
  } else {
    return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  }
};

export default ProtectedRoute;
```

In this updated version, I've added the PropsWithChildren type from react-router-dom to define the children property. I've also updated the ProtectedRoute component to accept a children prop and render it using the Outlet component from react-router-dom.

Now, when you use the ProtectedRoute component in your routes, you should be able to pass the children prop without any TypeScript errors. For example:

```
<Route path="/account" element={
  <ProtectedRoute roles={['customer']}>
    <AccountPage />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

This should render the AccountPage component only if the user has the 'customer' role.
